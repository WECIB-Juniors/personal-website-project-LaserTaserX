            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello There! Many people call me Alexander, Alex, or even Xander, but I go officially by Urgablur. I am a humanoid creature that loves competition, specifically in the field of Video Games, namely Clash Royale. I also love telling stories and making people laugh, though sometimes my jokes are a bit too dark for some people! I just think I need the right audience to have a good time, but I love everybody and harbor hate towards noone!</p>
            <p>Looking toward the future, I strive to blend creativity, technology, and strategy into something truly unique. I hope to craft experiences that inspire others to think differently, whether that’s through game design, digital art, or storytelling.</p>
