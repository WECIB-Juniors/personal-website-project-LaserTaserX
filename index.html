        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello There! Many people call me Alexander, Alex, or even Xander, but I go officially by Urgablur. I am a humanoid creature that loves competition, specifically in the field of Video Games, namely Clash Royale. I also love telling stories and making people laugh, though sometimes my jokes are a bit too dark for some people! I just think I need the right audience to have a good time, but I love everybody and harbor hate towards noone!</p>
        <p>Looking toward the future, I strive to blend creativity, technology, and strategy into something truly unique. I hope to craft experiences that inspire others to think differently, whether that’s through game design, digital art, or storytelling. I want to live a life defined by curiosity and creation, where each project pushes the boundaries of imagination and connects people across digital worlds. Every day, I aim to grow not just as a player, but as a builder of ideas and a shaper of communities.</p>
        <p>But my past wasn’t always this lighthearted. Long ago, I was exiled from the great data realms of Planet Corevex, betrayed by those I trusted most after a failed algorithmic experiment unleashed chaos on my home server. Cast adrift through the digital void, I wandered for eons: my code fractured, my name erased from the archives. It was only through Clash Royale’s arena that I found redemption, rebuilding my legacy one victory at a time. Now, I fight not just for trophies, but to reclaim the honor stolen from me by the corrupted programs that once called me brother.</p>
